# Description
DeepFix is an intelligent AI assistant that integrates directly into data science workflows (starting with PyTorch Lightning and MLflow). It automatically diagnoses common bugs in machine learning and provides a prioritized list of research-backed solutions. It leverages dataset statistics, ML testing (Deepchecks or evidentlyAI), and various metrics (e.g., loss values, evaluation metrics). From that, it fetches relevant information from our curated knowledge base to provide grounded answers to users.
