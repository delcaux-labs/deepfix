### üîÑ Implementation Notes

**Current Capabilities:**
- KnowledgeBridge can handle knowledge requests from other agents
- Multi-query generation using DSPy improves retrieval coverage
- Evidence validation ensures quality of retrieved knowledge
- Response synthesis creates coherent, cited summaries
- Caching reduces redundant LLM calls

**Design Decisions:**
- Skipped full ReAct implementation (P1.3) - current multi-query + validation approach is simpler and works well
- Used ChainOfThought instead of full ReAct for faster iteration and lower complexity
- Domain-specific indices provide targeted retrieval without complex tool selection
- Deduplication prevents redundant results from multi-query strategy

**Next Steps (If Continuing):**
- P1.3: Implement full ReAct agent with dynamic tool selection (optional, current approach sufficient for MVP)
- P2: Performance optimization (caching, lazy loading, hybrid search)
- P3: Production readiness (monitoring, evaluation, integration polish)

## Priority Decision Framework

When deciding what to work on next, use this decision tree:

```
Is another agent blocked waiting for this?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí üî¥ Critical Priority
‚îî‚îÄ NO
   ‚îÇ
   Does this directly improve recommendation quality?
   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí üü† High Priority
   ‚îî‚îÄ NO
      ‚îÇ
      Does this prevent production bottlenecks?
      ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí üü° Medium Priority
      ‚îî‚îÄ NO
         ‚îÇ
         Does this improve but not block functionality?
         ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí üü¢ Low Priority
         ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí ‚ö™ Future Priority
```

### Additional Considerations:
1. **User Value**: Will users notice this improvement?
2. **Technical Debt**: Does skipping this create future problems?
3. **Dependencies**: Does this unblock other work?
4. **Risk**: What's the cost of delay?

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Knowledge Base Quality is Poor
- **Impact**: HIGH - Wrong recommendations harm user trust
- **Probability**: MEDIUM - Initial curation may miss edge cases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Expert review of initial 50-60 documents
  - Start with well-established best practices only
  - Include confidence levels in all documents
  - Track user feedback on KB-backed recommendations
- **Monitoring**: User feedback scores, recommendation acceptance rate
- **Fallback**: Flag low-confidence recommendations, allow rule-based override

### Risk: Retrieval Latency Too High
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Slow responses frustrate users
- **Probability**: LOW - With caching and optimization
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement caching from day 1 (P0.3)
  - Set hard timeout limits (2s p95, 5s max)
  - Use efficient embedding models (small, fast)
  - Lazy index loading to reduce memory overhead
- **Monitoring**: p95/p99 latency, timeout rate
- **Fallback**: Return cached "best guess" if query times out, degrade to simpler retrieval

### Risk: Integration Complexity with Other Agents
- **Impact**: HIGH - Delays entire multi-agent system
- **Probability**: MEDIUM - Multiple moving parts
- **Mitigation**:
  - Define clean interfaces early (P0.1)
  - Mock KB responses for agent testing
  - Versioned request/response schemas
  - Comprehensive integration tests
- **Monitoring**: Integration test pass rate
- **Fallback**: Agents can operate without KB (degraded mode, rule-based only)

### Risk: Index Size Grows Uncontrollably
- **Impact**: LOW - Higher memory usage
- **Probability**: HIGH - Over time as KB grows
- **Mitigation**:
  - Lazy loading from P2.2 (load on demand)
  - Automatic unloading of unused indices
  - Document archival strategy (remove outdated knowledge)
  - Compression techniques for embeddings
- **Monitoring**: Memory usage alerts, index size metrics
- **Fallback**: Unload least-used indices, increase similarity threshold to reduce results

### Risk: DSPy/LlamaIndex Version Conflicts
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Breaking changes in dependencies
- **Probability**: MEDIUM - Libraries under active development
- **Mitigation**:
  - Pin specific versions in requirements
  - Regular dependency updates and testing
  - Abstract away library-specific code
  - Maintain compatibility layer
- **Monitoring**: Dependency vulnerability scans
- **Fallback**: Lock to last-known-good versions, manual patches
