## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Lazy Loading**: Load artifacts only when needed for analysis
- **Parallel Processing**: Analyze independent artifacts concurrently
- **Caching**: Cache analysis results for repeated artifact analysis
- **Memory Management**: Stream large files rather than loading entirely

### Performance Targets
- **Execution Time**: < 30 seconds for typical artifact set
- **Memory Usage**: < 500MB peak memory consumption
- **Throughput**: Support for 10+ concurrent analysis requests
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with artifact count

- **Partial Results**: Return findings from successful analyses
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error information for debugging
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures

### Fallback Mechanisms
- **Basic Validation**: Minimal checks when full analysis fails
- **Static Analysis**: File-based validation without content analysis
