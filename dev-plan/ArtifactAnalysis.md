## Overview

The `ArtifactAnalysisCoordinator` is responsible for validating artifacts, extracting metadata, and surfacing data quality signals across all artifact types in the DeepFix system. It acts as the first line of defense in the ML debugging pipeline by ensuring data integrity and identifying potential issues early in the analysis process.

**NEW DESIGN**: The agent now operates as a **coordinator** that orchestrates specialized analyzer agents, each equipped with domain-specific expertise and LLM-powered intelligence for sophisticated artifact analysis.

## Key Design Improvements

### Agent-Based Architecture
- **Domain Specialization**: Each analyzer agent focuses on specific artifact types with expert knowledge
- **LLM Integration**: All analyzer agents leverage LLM intelligence with specialized system prompts
- **Scalable Design**: New analyzer agents can be easily added for additional artifact types

### Specialized Analyzer Agents
- **TrainingArtifactsAnalyzerAgent**: Expert in training metrics, hyperparameters, and learning dynamics
- **DeepchecksArtifactsAnalyzerAgent**: Expert in data quality validation and drift detection
- **DatasetArtifactsAnalyzerAgent**: Expert in dataset statistics and ML readiness assessment
- **ModelCheckpointArtifactsAnalyzerAgent**: Expert in model integrity and deployment readiness

### LLM-Powered Intelligence
- **Contextual Analysis**: Each agent uses specialized system prompts for domain expertise
- **Structured Output**: LLM responses parsed into standardized findings and recommendations
- **Adaptive Analysis**: Intelligent interpretation of complex artifact patterns and anomalies
- **Actionable Insights**: Domain-specific recommendations with clear rationale and impact assessment

## Agent Coordination

### Agent Architecture Overview
The `ArtifactAnalysisCoordinator` operates as a **coordinator** that orchestrates specialized analyzer agents, each with domain-specific expertise and LLM-powered analysis capabilities:

#### Analyzer Agent Specialization
Each analyzer agent brings focused expertise:

- **TrainingArtifactsAnalyzer**: ML training diagnostics, hyperparameter analysis, convergence patterns
- **DeepchecksArtifactsAnalyzer**: Data quality validation, drift detection, integrity assessment
- **DatasetArtifactsAnalyzer**: Dataset statistics analysis, quality evaluation, ML readiness
- **ModelCheckpointArtifactsAnalyzer**: Model integrity validation, deployment readiness, compatibility

### Integration with Other DeepFix Agents

The `ArtifactAnalysisAgent` operates as a **foundational agent** in the DeepFix pipeline, providing artifact validation results that other agents depend on:

#### Downstream Agent Dependencies
- **CrossArtifactIntegrationAgent**: Consumes artifact analysis findings to perform cross-artifact consistency validation and relationship analysis
- **OptimizationAdvisorAgent**: Uses artifact quality assessments and analyzer recommendations to weight optimization advice confidence


#### Cross-Agent Intelligence Sharing
The agent-based design enables:
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Each analyzer brings deep domain expertise via specialized system prompts
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All artifact types analyzed with appropriate domain knowledge
- **Contextual Integration**: Coordinator agent can identify patterns across analyzer findings
- **Scalable Expertise**: New analyzer agents can be added for additional artifact types

**Note**: Cross-artifact analysis (comparing relationships between different artifact types) is handled by the specialized `CrossArtifactIntegrationAgent` which operates on the combined outputs of all analyzer agents.
