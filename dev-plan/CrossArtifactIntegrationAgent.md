# CrossArtifactIntegrationAgent Specification

## Overview

The `CrossArtifactIntegrationAgent` is a **prompt-driven synthesis agent** that intelligently interprets and correlates findings from multiple foundational agents. Rather than using hardcoded pattern detection logic, it leverages a sophisticated system prompt and flexible configuration to understand the relationships between agent outputs and provide holistic insights about experimental validity, data quality issues, and training problems.

**Core Philosophy**: This agent acts as an "ML debugging expert" that reviews findings from specialist agents and synthesizes them into coherent, actionable insights using natural language reasoning powered by LLMs.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Prompt-Driven Framework (Week 1)
- [X] Implement base `CrossArtifactIntegrationAgent` class with LLM integration


## Testing Strategy

### Prompt Effectiveness Testing
- **Known Scenario Validation**: Test with curated sets of agent findings representing known ML issues
- **Pattern Recognition Accuracy**: Validate that prompts correctly identify data leakage, overfitting, config drift
- **Causal Reasoning Quality**: Test ability to correctly identify cause-effect relationships
- **Confidence Calibration**: Ensure confidence scores correlate with actual accuracy

### Response Quality Validation  
- **Output Format Compliance**: Validate JSON responses match expected schema
- **Finding Coherence**: Ensure synthesized findings are logically consistent
- **Recommendation Actionability**: Test that recommendations are specific and implementable
- **Evidence Traceability**: Verify findings can be traced back to source agent results

### Robustness Testing
- **Edge Case Handling**: Test with missing, partial, or failed agent results
- **Prompt Injection Resistance**: Validate security against malicious agent findings
- **Fallback Reliability**: Test simple aggregation fallback when LLM fails
- **Multi-Agent Combinations**: Test with various combinations of available agents

### Performance Testing
- **LLM Response Time**: Monitor time for synthesis completion
- **Token Usage Optimization**: Track and optimize prompt token consumption
- **Caching Effectiveness**: Test caching of similar agent result patterns
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Validate handling of multiple synthesis requests
