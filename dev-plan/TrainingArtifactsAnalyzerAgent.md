## Core Analysis Components

### 1. Overfitting Detection

**Purpose**: Identify overfitting patterns through train-validation metric divergence analysis.

##### Specific Detection Methods
**Performance Gap Analysis**:
- Calculate absolute and relative gaps between train and validation metrics
- Track gap progression over training epochs
- Identify sudden gap increases or sustained divergence
- Compare against configurable thresholds

**Trend Divergence Detection**:
- Use moving averages to smooth training curves
- Calculate correlation between train and validation trends
- Detect inflection points where trends begin to diverge
- Assess severity based on divergence rate and duration

**Validation Plateau Detection**:
- Identify periods where validation metrics stop improving
- Use configurable window sizes for plateau detection
- Distinguish between temporary plateaus and genuine overfitting
- Consider learning rate schedule impact


### 2. Training Stability Analysis

**Purpose**: Assess training stability through metric variance and convergence analysis.

##### Loss Variance Analysis
- Calculate coefficient of variation for loss metrics

- Identify consistently low values (vanishing gradients)
- Track gradient norm distribution over time

##### Gradient Clipping Effectiveness
- Analyze when gradient clipping is triggered
- Assess clipping threshold appropriateness
- Detect patterns in clipped gradients
- Recommend optimal clipping values

### 4. Performance Trend Analysis

**Purpose**: Analyze training progress and performance trends to identify potential improvements.

- Detect learning rate schedule effectiveness
- Recommend learning rate adjustments

##### Training Efficiency Analysis
- Calculate convergence speed metrics
- Assess training efficiency relative to model size
- Identify potential for training acceleration
- Analyze resource utilization patterns

##### Performance Plateau Detection
- Identify when training stops improving
- Distinguish between temporary plateaus and convergence
- Assess potential for continued training
- Recommend intervention strategies

## Agent Coordination

### Integration with Other Agents

The `TrainingArtifactsAnalyzerAgent` operates as a **foundational agent** alongside `ArtifactAnalysisAgent`, providing training-specific insights that complement general artifact validation.

#### Downstream Agent Dependencies
- **CrossArtifactIntegrationAgent**: Uses training dynamics findings to correlate with data quality issues
- **OptimizationAdvisorAgent**: Leverages training analysis for hyperparameter and architecture recommendations

#### Input Dependencies
- **ArtifactAnalysisAgent**: Training dynamics analysis is more reliable when artifacts are validated
- Requires `TrainingArtifacts` to be present and validated in `AgentContext`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Individual Analysis Tests**: Each detection method tested with synthetic training curves
- **Edge Case Handling**: Missing metrics, incomplete training runs, corrupted data
- **Performance Testing**: Validate <10% overhead constraint with various dataset sizes

### Integration Testing
- **Real Training Data**: Test with actual PyTorch Lightning training outputs
- **Cross-Agent Compatibility**: Validate output format compatibility with downstream agents
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure execution time across different model scales

### Quality Assurance
- **Detection Accuracy**: Validate detection of known training issues (overfitting, instability)
- **Recommendation Quality**: Test recommendation effectiveness through user feedback
- **Confidence Calibration**: Ensure confidence scores correlate with detection accuracy


## Error Handling & Recovery


### Fallback Strategies
- **Partial Analysis**: Continue with available metrics when some data is missing
- **Simplified Detection**: Use basic heuristics when advanced analysis fails
- **Conservative Recommendations**: Provide safe, general recommendations when specific analysis is unavailable
- **Status Reporting**: Clear indication of analysis limitations in agent result
