## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

### Development Principles
- **Incremental Value**: Each sprint delivers working, user-testable functionality
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API contracts throughout development
- **Performance First**: Monitor and optimize performance at each sprint
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing before feature promotion
- **User Feedback**: Continuous collection and incorporation of user insights

### Risk Mitigation
- **Configuration-Based Fallbacks**:
  - [ ] Users can disable agent system via `fallback_to_legacy: true` config
  - [ ] Per-agent enable/disable configuration options
  - [ ] Environment-specific agent system toggles
  - [ ] Runtime feature flag support for gradual rollout
- **Graceful Degradation**:
  - [ ] Individual agent failures don't break pipeline execution
  - [ ] Partial results handling when some agents fail
  - [ ] Automatic fallback to legacy system on critical failures
  - [ ] Comprehensive error logging and alerting
- **Performance Guardrails**:
  - [ ] Agent-specific timeout configurations (`agent_timeouts`)
  - [ ] Automatic fallback if execution time exceeds thresholds
  - [ ] Memory usage monitoring and limits
  - [ ] Performance impact measurement and alerting
- **Quality Assurance**:
  - [ ] A/B testing ensures agent recommendations meet quality bar
  - [ ] Confidence threshold enforcement (`confidence_thresholds`)
  - [ ] Recommendation validation before user presentation
  - [ ] Continuous monitoring of recommendation effectiveness

### Validation Strategy

#### Technical Validation
- **Unit Tests**: Each agent tested independently with mock artifacts
- **Integration Tests**: Full pipeline tests comparing agent vs. legacy outputs  
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure agent system doesn't exceed current execution time budgets
- **Schema Validation**: Strict validation of agent inputs/outputs and data contracts

#### User Validation
- **A/B Testing**: Side-by-side comparison of agent vs. current recommendations
- **Feedback Collection**: Built-in rating system for recommendation usefulness
- **Success Metrics**: Track adoption rate of agent recommendations
- **Outcome Tracking**: Measure actual improvement in user training results

#### Fallback Strategy
- **Feature Flags**: Agent system can be disabled per user/environment  
- **Graceful Failures**: Pipeline continues even if individual agents fail
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic fallback if execution time exceeds thresholds

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- Existing DeepSightAdvisor pipeline must remain functional
- PyTorch Lightning and MLflow integrations must be maintained
- Deepchecks integration should be preserved and enhanced
- Current artifact loading and processing logic should be leveraged
