DeepFix is an intelligent AI assistant that integrates directly into the ML workflow (starting with PyTorch Lightning and MLflow). Our platform automatically diagnoses common bugs in machine learning and provides a prioritized list of solutions backed by industry/research best practices.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Bug Detection**: Identifies common ML issues automatically
- **Prioritized Solutions**: Get ranked suggestions based on best practices
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly works with PyTorch Lightning and MLflow
- **Research-Backed**: Solutions are grounded in industry standards and research

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/delcaux-labs/deepfix.git
cd deepfix

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv venv --python 3.11
uv pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from deepfix import DeepFix

# Initialize DeepFix with your MLflow experiment
deepfix = DeepFix(mlflow_experiment="my_experiment")

# Run diagnostics on your model
results = deepfix.diagnose(model, data_loader)

# Get prioritized solutions
solutions = results.get_solutions()
```
